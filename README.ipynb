    "# GDrive Audit\n",
    "Audit ownership in Google Drive folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "GDrive Audit produces a google sheet that shows all the files within a folder and their owners. This tool can aid in migrating folders into a Google _Shared Drive_. Run the audit tool to verify that all items contained within the _Shared Folder_ are owned by the team and are suitable for migrating into a _Shared Drive_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: When super-admins migrate a folder into a _Shared Drive_ all ownership of the files is tranferred to the organization. This is strictly a **ONE WAY** process and cannot be undone. If items that are meant for organization-wide consumption are migrated, the rest of the organization will lose access. Each item must be individually restored to the original owner. There **is no undo**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Any ASH user can audit a folder that is shared with them. The audit will be limited to folders that they can read in google drive. Ask the team to move all the folders that will be migrated into a shared folder and to give your user _Editor_ access to the shared folder. Follow the steps below to audit the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the program from this [link]() and unzip it\n",
    "    * ASH team members can download the [client_secrets.json file here] \n",
    "    * Place it in your Downloads folder (default location); it will be installed automatically\n",
    "    * Users ouside of the ASH.nl organization, can create their own client_secrets.json file by following the [Back end API instructions](#backendapi) below\n",
    "* Double click on the gdrive_audit executable to run it\n",
    "* Follow the prompts for authorizing the tool\n",
    "    - This tool needs to have read and write access to your Google Drive\n",
    "    - Rationale for Read Access: Each file in a folder is checked for ownership, file type and modification time\n",
    "    - Rationale for Write Access: A summary of the findings is uploaded to Google Sheets \n",
    "    - Rationale for Delete Access: This access is bundled together with the Write access\n",
    "* Paste in the URL of the folder you wish to migrate\n",
    "* Once the audit is complete, go on to [Auditing the Results](#Auditing)\n",
    "* Repeat the steps above as needed to audit additional folders\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='Auditing'></a>\n",
    "## Auditing the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After the audit is complete, a new file will be created in your _My Drive_. The link will be provided by the tool. The sheet can be used as-is or analyzed with a sheet that helps filter and organize the audited files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15U7uA7O9yAX61g_WPvdeGGuEninmJbnnyzA7wbHIaw0/copy) to make a copy of the filter. Follow the instructions embedded in the filter sheet.\n",

    "**What to look for when auditing a folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review the owners of the documents\n",
    "* Look for items that are owned by users **not** in the team\n",
    "* Review any suspect items with the team and confirm that these items should be moved into the shared drive\n",
    "    * If there is **any** doubt that the original owner can afford to lose access, **REMOVE** these items from the shared folder. The transfer to a _Shared Drive_ cannot be easily undone.\n",
    "    * Suspect items can be excluded from the migration by simply moving out of the shared folder.\n",
    "* Look for items that are owned by users **outside** of your organization \n",
    "    * These items will not be migrated and will be left in place. Some users find this distressing.\n",
    "    * Items that are owned by external users can be copied by someone in the team; the copy will be migrated.\n"
